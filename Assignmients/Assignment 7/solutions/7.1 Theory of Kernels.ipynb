    "# 7.1 Theory of Kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "Kernel methods are a way of implicitly mapping a data set to a higher dimension to increase the separability, e.g. for linear methods like PCA or support vector machines (SVM). In this exercise, we will review the fundamental properties of kernel functions and you have to decide for a list of functions whether they define a kernel or not.\n",

    "__Task 1__: Review the definition of a kernel function k(x,y). How can you construct a counterexample to show that a symmetric function is __not__ a kernel?\n",
    "\n",
    "Hint: Look at the two-dimensional case and the corresponding Gram-Matrix:\n",

    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "M(x,y)=\\begin{vmatrix} k( x,x) & k(x,y) \\\\\n",

    "Which requirement does the eigenvalues of M need to satisfy, if k(x,y) would be a kernel? Use the relationship between positive definiteness and the sign of the eigenvalues. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer:__\n",
    "The short answer is that the eigenvalues of M need to be non-negative. More general, we define a kernel as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $ \\mathcal X $ be a nonempty set, sometimes referred to as the index set. A symmetric function $ k: \\mathcal X \\times \\mathcal X \\to \\mathbb{R} $ is called a positive definite (p.d.) kernel on $\\mathcal X$ if:\n",

    "An equivalent requirement is that that the Gramian Matrix\n",

    "has to be positive semi-definite for all input vectors $(x_1,\\ldots,x_m) \\in \\mathcal X$. This is equivalent to the requirement that all eigenvalues are non-negative.\n",

    "__Task 2__: Given two kernels $k_1(x,y)$ and $k_2(x,y)$. Under which operation defines the combination of the two a new kernel? \n",
    "__Answer:__\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $k(x,y) = k_1(x,y) + k_2(x,y)$. The sum of two kernels is a new kernel.\n",
    "2. $k(x,y) = a \\cdot k_1(x,y)$  for $a>0$. Positive scaling defines a new kernel.\n",
    "3. $k(x,y) = k_1(x,y) \\cdot k_2(x,y)$. The product of two kernels is a new kernel.\n",
    "4. Let $\\mathbf f: \\mathbb {R} ^N \\rightarrow \\mathbb R$. Then $k(x,y) = f(x) \\cdot f(y)$ is a kernel. If a kernel is separable into two independent factors depending on the same function, then their product is a new kernel.\n",
